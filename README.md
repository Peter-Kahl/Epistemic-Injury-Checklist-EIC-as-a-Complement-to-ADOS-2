## Abstract

This repository hosts a policy and clinical discussion paper introducing the Epistemic Injury Checklist (EIC) as a supplementary formulation and triage aid to complement ADOS-2 in autism and ADHD assessment pathways. The EIC addresses a recognised gap in behavioural diagnostic tools by focusing on developmental and relational conditions that disrupt an individual’s capacity to safely express, test, and trust their own perceptions—patterns that can converge with ASD or ADHD presentations across childhood and adulthood.

The paper is addressed to clinicians, multidisciplinary teams, service leads, commissioners, and policy professionals working within NHS, private, and third-sector neurodevelopmental services. It is intended to support differential formulation, reduce diagnostic ambiguity, and inform proportionate intervention and service design, while remaining fully aligned with NICE-based assessment processes.
