## Abstract

Increasing demand for autism and ADHD assessments has led to growing reliance on standardised behavioural instruments such as ADOS-2 within NHS, private, and third-sector diagnostic pathways. While these tools are essential, well-validated, and NICE-aligned, they are not designed to distinguish neurodevelopmental conditions from behaviour patterns arising from chronic relational inhibition, trauma adaptation, masking, or disrupted epistemic environments. Under conditions of service pressure and time-constrained assessment, such patterns can converge behaviourally with autism or ADHD presentations across both childhood and adulthood.

This repository hosts a policy and clinical discussion paper introducing the Epistemic Injury Checklist (EIC) as a supplementary formulation and triage aid intended to complement, not replace, existing diagnostic instruments. The EIC focuses on identifying markers of epistemic injury—developmental disruptions in an individual’s capacity to safely express, test, and trust their own perceptions—which may shape presentation, coping strategies, and engagement with assessment contexts.

The paper clarifies the conceptual relationship between EIC and ADOS-2, outlines practical use cases across referral triage, developmental history-taking, multidisciplinary team formulation, and post-assessment support planning, and situates EIC explicitly within NICE-aligned pathways. It argues that incorporating an explicit epistemic–developmental formulation layer may improve differential assessment, reduce diagnostic ambiguity, support more proportionate intervention, and inform service design under conditions of rising demand and constrained capacity.

The paper is addressed to clinicians, multidisciplinary teams, service leads, commissioners, educators, and policy professionals involved in autism and ADHD assessment pathways, and is intended to support reflective practice, formulation quality, and system-level decision-making rather than to provide diagnostic guidance.
